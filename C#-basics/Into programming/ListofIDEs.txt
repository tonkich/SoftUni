1.Eclipse
This is the best alternative if you are not a big fan of Microsoft’s Visual Studio.
The interface is a lot cleaner and concise than Visual Studio and the languages that are possible to use extend past the .Net Framework.
Besides being the number on way to develop Android applications via the Android SDK, it is fully extensible to use languages such as Ruby, C, C++ and many many more.
2.Oracle Netbeans 7
If you are more of a Java developer, Oracle's got your back with their Netbeans IDE. 
Of course, despite the fact that excellent Java support is its claim to fame going as far back as the Sun Microsystems days,
other languages like C/C++, Ruby, HTML5, PHP and more are supported as well. Netbeans is extremely extensible via its plugin-centric design,
allowing you to add additional language syntax support and libraries, among other things.
Netbeans is free under the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) v1.0 and GNU General Public License (GPL) v2.
3.Code::Blocks
Code::Blocks, which is built on the wxWidgets framework, is exceptionally lightweight in size, yet still quite functional and feature-rich IDE.
You can load up a number of under-the-hood compiler engines, ranging from GCC and LLVM, to Digital Mars and Open Watcom.
Code::Blocks also takes advantage of multi-core compiling, allowing you to get the job done faster.
Code::Blocks is distributed under the GPL v3.0 license which means it can be used freely by anyone.
4.Aptana Studio 3
If web and scripting languages are more of your style, Aptana is well suited for the task. PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Python are supported as well as the likes of Adobe AIR.
Even the studio itself is available as a plugin for Eclipse if you prefer the way Aptana handles your work and want to combine it with a more comprehensive IDE.
Aptana Studio 3 is free and available solely under the GNU General Public License.
5.gedit
Gedit is the official editor of the gnome desktop and comes installed once the system is setup.
Very useful for the user that is casually editing code and not undertaking major projects. This would be a good companion to Netbeans or Eclipse.
